# 4dventure v1.2.2 â€“ Chuck the Plant #

## Are you ready for an 4dventure? ##

Do you remember the old days when text adventures where the best thing ever?
When ZORK started a big video game revolution?

4dventure brings back those days!

4dventure is an easy to use text adventure environment.
Just type a map using ASCII-charakters,
assign functions to simple commands
and be creative!

And if you need more than just that -- don't worry!
All scripting you want can be done in Lua, a simple
yet powerful programming language.
