== Are you ready for an 4dventure? ==

Do you remember the old days when text adventures where the best thing ever?
When ZORK started a big video game revolution?

4dventure brings back those days!

4dventure is an easy to use text adventure environment.
Just type a map using ASCII-charakters,
assign functions to simple commands
and be creative!

And if you need more then just that -- don't worry --
all scripting you like can be done in Lua!

== Future plans ==

We're planning to add options to compile 4dventure
as a static or shared library
allowing you to add more advanced features.

== Development ==

You can find the main repository at
http://ki-omniarts.de/hg/4dventure/
where there will always be the newest version online for you.
